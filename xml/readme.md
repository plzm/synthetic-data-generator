A random XML generator. Given an XML schema (XSD), generates a corresponding XML document with random element/attribute values.

Implemented as a .NET Standard 2.0 DLL. For compatibility info, see https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard

Based on https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302296.aspx, created in 2004 by Priya Lakshminarayanan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/prial/). Modified heavily for functionality, structure, and encapsulation by Patrick El-Azem, in particular implementing actual random value generation which the original did not have.
